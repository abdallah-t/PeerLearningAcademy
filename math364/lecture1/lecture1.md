## angles

### what is an angle?

What is an angle? In Plane Geometry, a figure which is formed by two rays or lines that shares a common endpoint is called an angle.
### degrees

if asked you what is a degree, you would probably say that it is a unit of measurement for angles, but what does that mean?

the definition of a degree is that it is 1/360 of a full rotation, that's it, it's that simple. but this question raises another question, why 360?

there are many stories, but the most common one is because it in the past they've used base 60 system and it has many divisors, which means that it can be divided by many numbers without a remainder, and that makes it easier to work with.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, 360
### radians

radians are another unit of measurement for angles, but what is it?

the definition of a radian is that it is the angle that is formed when the arc length is equal to the radius of the circle, but what does that mean?

what if the circle is very big? well, the arc length will be very big, and the angle will be the remain the same. as you can see.
### how to convert between degrees and radians?

a full rotation is 360 degrees and it is also 2π radians, so we can say that 360 degrees is equal to 2π radians.

$$ 360 \text{ deg} = 2\pi \text{ rad}$$
$$ 180 \text{ deg} = \pi \text{ rad}$$
$$ \frac{180 \text{ deg}}{\pi \text{ rad}} = 1$$

so if we want to convert 30 degrees to radians, we can do the following:

$$\begin{aligned} 30 \text{ deg} &= \frac{30 \text{ deg}}{1} \\
&= \frac{30 \text{ deg}}{1} \times \frac{\pi \text{ rad}}{180 \text{ deg}} \\
&= \frac{30 \times \pi \text{ rad}}{180} \\
&= \frac{\pi}{6} \text{ rad} \end{aligned}$$

and if we want to convert 2 radians to degrees, we can do the following:

$$\begin{aligned} 2 \text{ rad} &= \frac{2 \text{ rad}}{1} \\
&= \frac{2 \text{ rad}}{1} \times \frac{180 \text{ deg}}{\pi \text{ rad}} \\
&= \frac{2 \times 180 \text{ deg}}{\pi} \\
&= \frac{360}{\pi} \text{ deg} \end{aligned}$$

### exercise 1

convert the following to radians:

1. 45 degrees

$$ \frac{45 \times \pi \text{ rad}}{180} = \frac{\pi}{4} \text{ rad}$$

2. 60 degrees

$$ \frac{60 \times \pi \text{ rad}}{180} = \frac{\pi}{3} \text{ rad}$$

convert the following to degrees:

1. 3 radians
$$ \frac{3 \times 180 \text{ deg}}{\pi} = \frac{540}{\pi} \text{ deg}$$

2. 4$\pi$ radians
$$ \frac{4\pi \times 180 \text{ deg}}{\pi} = 720 \text{ deg}$$

## what are Sin, Cos, and Tan?

### sin

well, it has many definitions, but the most common one is that
sin is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse

what do we mean by that? let's look at an example:

### exercise 2

### cos

cos is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse

### tan

tan is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side

and it is also the ratio of sin to cos and we can proof it by the following:

$$\begin{aligned} \tan\theta &= \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \\
\tan\theta &= \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \times 1 \\
\tan\theta &= \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \times \frac{\frac{1}{\text{hypotenuse}}}{\frac{1}{\text{hypotenuse}}}\\
\tan\theta &= \frac{\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}{\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}\\
\tan\theta &= \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} \end{aligned}$$

## what is sec, csc, and cot?

### sec

sec is the reciprocal of cos

### csc

csc is the reciprocal of sin

### cot

cot is the reciprocal of tan
## what is co?

if you've noticed, cosine and sine are basically the same but there are two letters added what do we mean by **co**sine?

co is short for complementary, which means that it is the same as the other function but with a 90 degree difference
so cosine basically means the sine of the complementary angle which is this angle:
