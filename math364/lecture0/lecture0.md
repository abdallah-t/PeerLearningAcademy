# Lecture 1: Introduction

## Who am I?

My name is Abdullah Tantawy and I'm a first year computer science student. I'm also a math enthusiast and I love to teach math. And I want to share my knowledge on how I got the full mark in this course with you.

## What are we going to study in this course?

this course consists of 3 units:

- ### unit 1: Trigonometry

    dealing with triangles and their properties and relations between their sides and angles.

    this would be the most important unit in this course.

- ### unit 2: analzying functions

    dealing with functions and their properties and relations between their variables and the curve it makes.

- ### unit 3: limits and derivatives

    dealing with the limit of a function and the derivative of a function.

## Requirements

you will need the following:

- a scientific calculator
- pen and dedicated notebook for this course

## FAQ

- why did they make a whole science out of triangles?

    because triangles are the most basic shape in geometry and they are the building blocks of all other shapes. You can construct any shape using triangles.
    <!-- show a video of how to construct a polygon with triangles. -->
    <!-- show a video of a 3d ball made of triangles. -->
- why do we need to study this?

    because it is the foundation of all other math and science courses. You will need it in physics, chemistry, engineering, and even in computer science.
    <!-- show a video of how trigonometry is used in physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. -->


## How to study this course?

- ### watch the lecture videos

    I will be posting lecture videos on youtube. You can watch them at your own pace. make sure to pause the video and try to solve the examples on your own before I solve them in the video.

- ### do the exercises

    I'll be posting exercises in description of each video. make sure to do them and check your answers.

- ### ask questions

    if you have any question make sure to ask me in the comments of the video or in the whatsapp group. and try to answer other students' questions if you can.
